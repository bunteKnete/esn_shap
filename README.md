# esn_shap

This is a minimal example of kernalshap with my echo state network (ESN). It loads a pretrained ESN and input data from disk.
The purpose of this repo is to provide an example for users of StackOverFlow in order to be able to help with errors in the code or application of the R package "kernelshap".
